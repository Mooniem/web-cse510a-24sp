# Course Overview

{/* <Alert severity='error'>Content is Under Development and Subject to Change</Alert> */}

## Course Description

This class is about the design and use of computing technology. You will learn about fundamental methods and principles for designing, prototyping, and evaluating user interfaces, including graphical, natural-language, voice-based, and tangible user interfaces. You will apply these methods and principles in a quarter-long design project. To help you find a good solution to your design problem, you will learn about cognitive principles, how we can design for human diversity, and practice methods for anticipating differential and societal impacts of technology. 

The course structure is a mix of lectures, hands-on activities, and design critiques by peers and course staff.
The course is overwhelmingly organized around a group project, in which students:

- Ideate and Propose Design Problems
- Study Existing Practices and Challenges
- Explore Potential Design Opportunities and Tradeoffs
- Evaluate and Iterate Upon a Design
- Communicate a Problem and Resulting Design

## Learning Objectives

At the end of this course, you will have gained: 
- a process-focused perspective on human-centered design
- design research methods and skills
- an understanding of task-focused scenario development, sketching, and prototyping
- a critical perspective on design solutions
- knowledge and tools for understanding cognitive principles and for anticipating societal impacts of technology

including the opportunities this course provides working with a group in an intensive project.

Total points: 80

- __(30 points)__: Group Project (GA)
  - __(4 points)__: Assignment 1, Project Brainstorming and Proposal
  - __(4 points)__: Assignment 2, Sketches
  - __(4 points)__: Assignment 3, Personas and updated project proposal
  - __(4 points)__: Assignment 4, Unintended consequences
  - __(3 points)__: Assignment 5, Bad design hunt
  - __(4 points)__: Assignment 6, Paper prototype and evaluation
  - __(3 points)__: Assignment 7, Initial high fidelity prototype

  - __(4 points)__: Assignment 1, Intro and motivation
  - __(4 points)__: Assignment 2, Design process
  - __(4 points)__: Assignment 3, Design critique
  - __(4 points)__: Assignment 4, Testing

- __(30 points)__: Participation
  - __(10 points)__:Engagement in class discussions / Q&A
  - __(20 points)__:Feedback on other people’s projects on Figma (leave at least one meaningful piece of feedback each for four different projects, excluding your own group’s project)

Each assignment will also provide a point breakdown intended to convey how it will be graded.
Design is an inherently subjective practice, and so grading in this course is necessarily subjective.
The stated project requirements are the minimum,
intended to leave room for groups to earn strong grades through strong work.

Because the course is designed around feedback on project milestones, grades given to those milestones indicate
that you have invested sufficient effort and insight at the time of the milestone.
You will get feedback and are expected to continue acting upon that feedback in your design process.
The bulk of project grades is therefore attached to the final deliverables, which are evaluated on their quality.

## Participation

This is an in-person class with regular hands-on activities that are difficult to do remotely or in a hybrid way. In-person attendance is generally expected and is part of participation grading. If you absolutely cannot attend a class, make sure to check with your team whether they can have you join remotely for the group project activities. 

We will record the lecture-part of each class and will share it on Canvas the day after the class.
