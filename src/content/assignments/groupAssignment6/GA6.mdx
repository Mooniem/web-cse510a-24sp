# Group Assignment 6: Paper prototype and evaluation


## Overview
Develop a paper prototype for your design.
It should convey all critical aspects of your design, including support for testing your two primary tasks. 
Then conduct a wizard-of-oz experiment with your paper prototype, 
noting down all usability issues your testers encounter. 
Submit photos of your paper prototype as well as a PDF describing (1) 
the two primary tasks the prototype supports (1-2 sentences each), 
and (2) a list of usability issues you have found along with how you are planning to address them.
