# Group Assignment 5: Bad Design Hunt

## Overview
Find examples of bad design in your sketches based on the heuristics we discussed in class. 
List at least 5 such examples in a table, clearly describing which heuristic your design violates and how, 
as well as how you plan to improve the design. You may use images/sketches/screenshots of your design to illustrate. 
If your design absolutely does not include any examples of bad design, 
you may also include examples of good design according to the heuristics 
(but make sure to clearly label these as examples of good design).
