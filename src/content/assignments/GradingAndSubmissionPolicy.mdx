## Original Work Policy and Plagiarism

Plagiarism is the use of another person’s words or ideas without attribution to their source. In American intellectual culture, this is considered a form of cheating, dishonesty, and/or theft. At the University of Washington and in professional settings generally, plagiarism is an extremely serious matter.

In your writing for this course (and in most professional settings), please paraphrase whenever possible. This helps you process and understand what you have read. 
If truly necessary, you can quote published work and the use of AI programs (see below), but quotations must be clearly marked and properly attributed. You may obtain copy editing assistance, and you may discuss your ideas with others — 
but all substantive writing and ideas must be your own or else be explicitly attributed to another, using a citation. The exact form of the citation is not important; what matters is that you provide sufficient detail for someone else to easily relocate your source, even years later (so URLs alone are insufficient).

All cases of plagiarism will be reported immediately. There will be no warnings, no second chances, no opportunity to rewrite. 
Consequences can range from failing the assignment (a grade of zero) or failing the course to expulsion from the University. 
If you have the slightest doubt about whether you are using the words or ideas of others appropriately, please ask.

## Generative AI policy
Unlike blog posts and research articles, you do not need to attribute artifacts/quote text produced by generative AI when you use it. However, you must do the following or you will face academic consequences including but not limited to failing an assignment or an exam.  - You must cite the AI program you used in the artifact you hand in  - If it copies text from other sources and you don’t provide proper attribution, you will be held accountable for that.  - If it provides ideas that are not your own, you will need to find and properly cite the original source.  - You must still comply with the academic integrity policies of the institution. This includes refraining from using generative AI to plagiarize or cheat.

You will be held to the same standards when you use generative AI as for any assignment, regardless of whether you or the AI created something. Specifically this means that if you turn in artifacts that contain false or incomplete claims, you will be graded accordingly.   We recommend that you use generative AI in moderation, if at all. Generative AI can help you to summarize text, improve grammer, write code, collect relevant resources to read, and generate ideas. However if you start to rely solely on it, you may limit your own development in critical thinking and writing, and if the results are that your writing is narrower and shallower in scope this may impact your grade. Also please note that using such tools may imply donating your data to the companies that deployed them.

To summarize, you may use generative AI unless otherwise specified. However, you must use it ethically, check its output, and ensure that you do not cheat or plagiarize when using it. Further, you will most likely not receive a high grade if you rely on it to the exclusion of your own critical thinking, writing and accessibility skills.
