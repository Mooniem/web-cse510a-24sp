# Group Assignment 3: Personas and updated project proposal

## Overview
From your design sketches, select one design that you will refine in the remainder of this course. 
Then select two tasks that will be the focus of your design refinement. 
The selected tasks need to be representative of the experience of using your design.

Prepare one paragraph describing why you selected the design you did. Draw upon feedback from critiques, 
data from your design research, and your three personas.
- Why this design and these tasks?
- What makes the design better suited to the personas for whom you are targeting your design? 
- Why are these tasks more compelling than the others?

Convey a strong understanding of which design you chose, which tasks you chose, and why you chose them. 
Please use the three personas you developed to justify your choice.
