# Group Assignment 2: Sketches

## Overview

Building on what you learned in your user research, design six tasks that you believe are integral to your overall design goal:
You should include existing tasks (i.e., tasks people already do) and new tasks (i.e., tasks that will be enabled by your design).
These should be real world tasks that have details (e.g., instead of “programming a DVR”, details like “programming a DVR to record the Simpsons on Sundays”).
These tasks should not have any specific relation to the exact design sketches you will brainstorm next.
Your six tasks should span a wide range of functionality and difficulty, from easy to hard tasks.

Each task should be described in brief bullet points. Tasks say what is accomplished, 
leaving open how to accomplish it. So be sure that your task conveys a problem and what is accomplished, rather than a step-by-step walkthrough of scenario with a particular design.

Next, sketch three very different initial designs for your interface:
- Each of the three designs should support four of your six tasks, but each sketch does not necessarily need to support the same four tasks as the other sketches.
- Sketch key aspects needed to illustrate the functionality in your four tasks. A design may imply additional tasks, but do not illustrate the entire design.
- These should be rough sketches on paper, including illustrations of their relations (e.g., arrows showing transitions and relationships). 

The purpose of these sketches is to explore the design space before you lock yourself into a single design. They must demonstrate significant consideration of substantially different approaches to your problem. Each sketch should include a short text description of which tasks are supported and how (1-5 sentences for each task).
